# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction-using-Pipelines

  --->In this notebook ,we will build a machine learning model to predict whether or not a customer cancelled a hotel booking.

  --->We will use a fairly general dataset, this dataset is also available on Kaggle.


  --->Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? 
          Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? 

  --->What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a 
        disproportionately high number of special requests?


   --->This data set is ideal for anyone looking to practice their exploratory data analysis (EDA) or get started in building predictive models!

   --->If you're looking for inspiration on data visualizations, check out the #TidyTuesday program, a free, 
        weekly online event that encourages participants to create and share their code and visualizations for a given data set on Twitter.

   --->This data set contains a single file which compares various booking information between two hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel.
